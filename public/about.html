<h1>About Andrew Williams</h1>
<hr />
<p>I'm Andrew Williams, Director of Cybersecurity at Juul Labs, with over 14 years of IT experience focused on threat hunting, 
  malware analysis, and incident response. At News Corp, I led incident response across brands like The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch.com,
  HarperCollins, Realtor.com, and the New York Post—working directly with BISOs and the CISO to manage high-impact incidents.</p>

<p>Earlier in my career, I contracted for the Department of Homeland Security, supporting USCIS and U.S. Border Patrol operations along 
  the Texas–Mexico border. I also served for many years in both the National Guard and Texas State Guard, leading cybersecurity and emergency 
  incident response during major state crises.</p>

<p>I'm an innovator who thrives on solving complex security challenges, mentoring the next generation of defenders, 
  and staying curious—whether that's through hacking, skiing, or learning something new.</p>
